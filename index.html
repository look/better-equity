  <h1>Too many employees lose their stock options.<br> It's time for <strong>Better Equity</strong>.</h1>

  <p>At a typical startup, employees must exercise their stock options within 90 days of leaving, or they lose them. Paying to exercise stock options is a risky bet that can incur a huge tax bill (<a href="#details">details</a>). This causes employees to de-value equity, making it hard for startups to attract the best people. Companies can fix this by allowing employees a longer period of time to exercise their options.</p>

  <h2>Companies with extended exercise</h2>

  <p>The following companies have publicly stated that they give employees more time to exercise their options:</p>
  
  <table class="company-list">
    {% for company in page.companies %}
      <tr>
        <td><a href="{{ company.url }}">{{ company.name }}</a></td>
        <td>{{ company.details }}<sup><a href="{{ company.details_url }}">[{{ forloop.index }}]</a></sup></td>
      </tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </table>
 
  <h2 id="details">A major problem with employee equity</h2>

  <p>Startups typically compensate employees in a combination of salary and equity, in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive_stock_option">incentive stock options</a>. Employees take a smaller salary with the belief that if the company does well, their stock options will make up the difference.</p>

  <p>Sadly, even when a startup does do well, this is often not the case. Employee stock options as granted by most startups <strong>must be exercised within 90 days of leaving</strong>. This causes two problems for employees:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Many employees will not have the money to do so and will have to forfeit the options -- which they earned in exchange for lower salary compensation.</li>
    <li>Worse, exercising options can cause a huge tax bill. If the strike price has increased since an employee's grant, the increase is considered taxable under the Alternative Minimum Tax (<a href="https://medium.com/@barryjk/the-tax-law-that-is-unintentionally-hammering-silicon-valley-employees-894a7b54ba8a">read more</a>). If the company later fails, former employees who exercised their options will have paid considerable taxes for a worthless asset.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Within three months of leaving a job, employees must decide if they will make a risky gamble buying an illiquid asset that is taxed immediately.</p>

  <p>Faced with this decision, many employees walk away from their equity. This causes employees to de-value equity, and that makes it hard for startups to attract the best people.</p>
 
  <h2>How to fix it</h2>

  <p>One way to avoid these problems is to early exercise. However, this may require a large amount of cash and is often offered only to very early employees (or not at all).</p>

  <p>Easier and friendlier to all employees is for companies to allow a longer exercise window for stock options. By extending the exercise window, employees can exercise their options once a liquidity event occurs -- or simply once they've saved enough to cover their costs. Allowing a longer exercise window significantly de-risks the decision to purchase stock options.</p>

  <p>The purpose of <strong>Better Equity</strong> is to highlight companies that offer this benefit. These companies may or may not succeed. But if they do, their employees will have a better chance of sharing in the proceeds.</p>
